The scripts use the [kernel subsystem](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/subsystem-apis.html) device files as described in [LED handling under Linux](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/leds/leds-class.html).

Successfully tested on [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/) and on [Raspbian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
